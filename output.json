      "description": "The term, “leaving no one behind”, has been mentioned in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)",
      "content": "Ramani Kanta Thakuria(The author is the former Chief Scientist, Chief Scientist, Water Management, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat. Currently, he is working as a Principal Scientist at Khanapara Campus, AAU, Guwahati-22. thakuriark@gmail.com) The term, \"leaving no one behind\", has been mentioned in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) - a UN declaration specifically made after Millennium Development Goal (MDG) in 2015 for meeting the needs of people by the year-2030. The Declaration states that nobody in the society irrespective of differences in race, colour, sex, language, or religion should be barred from achieving their potential and their fair share in progress. It was also stressed that everyone in society should be able to live in dignity. SDG 6 is related to water with a similar objective to ensure the availability and sustainable use of water for all by 2030. In the context of water as a fundamental item of any living being, livelihood, food security and sustainable development, \"leaving no one behind\" is very much crucial. Gradual increase in demand for water especially due to rapid population growth, faster urbanization, large industrialization and changing lifestyles has made it more crucial and challenging. Thus, uniform and ensured availability of such a critical item for the future is of due concern.\"Leaving no one behind\" in case of availability of water presently is considered to be a moral, social and economic issue as billions of people are still living without safe water. Data indicate that by the year 2025, about 3 billion people will be in the water stress category with 1700 m3 of available water per capita per year (on a scale of 500m3-absolute scarce, 500-1000m3-scarcity and 1000-1700m3-stress). Presently, about 2.1 billion people in the world are living without safe water at home, more than 700 children below five years of age die every day due to the use of unsafe water and poor sanitation, eight out of ten households need to use water collected by girls or women from its distant sources, around 159 million people collect their drinking water from surface water either ponds or stream and around 4 billion people of world experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. The benefits of \"leaving no one behind\" with respect to water are immense as per capita availability of water determines everything of one's lifestyle from dressing to food habits, sanitation, health etc. The newer terms like marginal water, virtual water, water footprint etc., may be mentioned in this regard. The important aspect of an equal share of water is to identify the magnitude of populations who continue to be left behind. They are generally a marginalized population covering women, children, refugees, indigenous and disabled people and many others. The evidence shows that achieving the target to \"leave no one behind\" especially on the waterfront are tough job and shall be tougher over time. Water as a commodity of finite in its volume will vary in its availability with time. Its quality, as well as competitive demand by different sectors along with population increase, is again going to intensify the severity of the situation in coming years. Globally, the potential availability of water decreased from 12900 m3 per capita per year in 1970 to 9000 m3 in 1990, less than 7000 m3 in 2000 and is projected to hit as low as 5100 m3 per capita by the year 2025. In densely populated Asia, Africa, and Central and southern Europe, current per capita water availability is even much lesser ranging between 1200-5000m3. From a national perspective, India is having only 4 per cent of total global water and needs to support 17 per cent of the human and 15 per cent of the livestock population of the world. Out of the total annual precipitation of 4000-billion cubic metres (BCM), the utilizable water resources of the country have been assessed as 1123 BCM, of which 690 BCM is from surface water and 433 BCM from groundwater sources. The projected total water demand of 1447 BCM in 2050 will cross the present level of utilizable water resources (1123 BCM) out of which 1047 BCM will be for agriculture alone. Since the total projected demand will be 324 BCM more than the present level of utilizable water resources, the options to address the situation will be more production from less water by efficient use of utilizable water resources in irrigated areas, productivity enhancement of challenged ecosystem, utilization of a part of greywater for agriculture production and recharging of groundwater from runoff water. Assam is endowed with vast water resources. High rainfall (annual average is about 2250 mm), and the presence of large numbers of rivers and other water bodies with rich groundwater aquifers in the state signifies the vastness of the water resources. The state has two big river systems viz. the Brahmaputra and the Barak with 73 important tributaries of the Brahmaputra River and 11 tributaries of the Barak River. Surface water resource in terms of area coverage by rivers and other water bodies in the state is estimated to be about 8251 sq. km. This is 10.5 per cent of the total geographical area of the state. The groundwater potentiality of the state is also very rich. The state has the potential of about 28.52 BCM of replenishable groundwater of which 90.42 per cent (25.79 BCM) is available for utilization. The net draft of groundwater is very low only 3.49 BCM. Thus, the stage of groundwater development for the state is very low only about 14 per cent. This gives a very high per capita annual water availability value in comparison to the national average of about 1700 m3. Although the overall availability of water in the state is very high, because of spatial and temporal variability of rainfall there is variability in the actual per capita availability over time and place. Spatial variation of rainfall indicates that availability is the lowest in the Hilly zone and the highest in the Barak valley zone. In the same agro-climatic zone itself, there is significant variation in the availability of water. Among the various uses in the state, the trend in water use for irrigation purposes is increasing. Presently, only about 50 per cent of the cultivated area of the state is under double cropping. To bring all the cultivated area under double cropping or more than that, all the cultivated area will need to be provisioned with irrigation facilities resulting in higher irrigation water demand in the state. If the whole cultivable area is brought under irrigation and all the created potential is utilized, the issue of sustainability in water use would be of prime concern. Apart from the irrigation, the second most important aspect of water use is the domestic need for water for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing etc. In Assam, the population is increasing at a faster rate recording a decadal growth rate of about 17 per cent from 2001-to 2011. According to the population census of India, in 2011; the total population of the state was 3.12 crore against the 0.80 crores in 1951. If such a rate of population growth persists, the requirement for water to meet the domestic demand would be very high. The domestic requirement of water for the urban population is generally high because of improved lifestyles and changed food habits. In Assam, the proportion of the urban population increased from 12.9 per cent in 2001 to 14.0 per cent in 2011. This again indicates more requirements for water in future. Details estimate for the projected demand for water for the state is insufficient. However, a gross demand of 62.4 BCM for the year 2050 has been estimated for meeting domestic, industrial and irrigation needs etc. Approaches for sustainable use of water are always essential for any geographical entity and need to be adopted suitably on priority for \"leaving no one behind\" for the state. In Assam, rainwater management includes the development and utilization of micro-level water resources, adoption of suitable cropping systems, adoption of proper irrigation schedule to match spatial and temporal behaviour of water availability, design and utilization of micro-irrigation systems; groundwater management including utilization of groundwater on the basis of aquifer characteristics and recharging of groundwater in the over-exploited area; canal water management including improved conveyance and application of irrigation water system, multiple uses of irrigation water, conjunctive use of rain, canal and groundwater; and on-farm water management with the proper transfer of technology are some of the examples of approaches for sustainable water use. Like other issues, sustainable use of water requires proper planning like an assessment of the available water resources first and then deciding how best it can be used. Sustainability also remains in better co-operation between all water stakeholders. The success or failure of \"leaving no one behind\" will be judged whether all persons are being covered or not. What is more important is a distinct pathway to reach all the people. Any inaction or deficiency in action in this aspect will result differently.",

      "description": "Will Smith once revealed that he hated the image of black men sleeping around so much that it was a reason he chose not to do so himself.",
      "content": "Will Smith was well aware that being a box office superstar and celebrity gave him a lot of sex appeal to his fans. The Oscar-winner acknowledged that many women probably would’ve wanted to attempt to seduce the star. But Smith made it a point not to sleep around as other celebrities might have. This was because he didn’t want to promote a negative reputation he felt black men had. Will Smith once revealed he had sex with so many women that it made him sick Will Smith | Jerod Harris/Getty Images As can be the case with some teenagers, Smith once shared that he was very promiscuous during his teenage years. But this promiscuity stemmed from a broken heart the Bad Boys star admitted he was trying to mend in his memoir Will. A 16-year-old Smith was dating Melanie, a friend he moved into his household due to her own familial problems. Melanie would eventually cheat on Smith, sending the rapper down his early promiscuous path. “I desperately need relief but as there is no pill for heartbreak, I resorted to the homeopathic remedies of shopping and rampant sexual intercourse,” he wrote. “Up until this point in my life, I had only had sex with one woman other than Melanie, but over the next few months, I went full ghetto hyena.” But this particular method of healing backfired, as Smith soon realized this new lifestyle didn’t align with who he was. “I had sex with so many women, and it was so constitutionally disagreeable to the core of my being, that I developed a psychosomatic reaction to having an orgasm,” he admitted. “It would literally make me gag and sometimes even vomit… In every case, though, I hoped to God this beautiful stranger would be ‘the one’ who would love me, who would make this pain go away, but invariably, there I was, retching and wretched. And the look in the eyes of the women even further deepened my agony.” Will Smith didn’t have sex with multiple women because he didn’t want to promote the image of black men being promiscuous In his later years, Smith would become one of the biggest stars of all time. His newfound celebrity would’ve given him access and the opportunity to form even more relationships with other women. But instead, during his rise to megastardom, Smith chose to settle down. First with ex-wife Sheree Zampino, and then with his current partner Jada Pinkett. For Smith, it was important to avoid the temptation of sleeping around with multiple women. The actor admitted this was a bit of a struggle sometimes. But to Smith, it’s a struggle that was worth it if it meant shattering an image about black men that he hates. “Tons of women would love to have sex with me,” he once said in a 2001 interview with ABC News. “I hate the image of black men as promiscuous and unable to control themselves sexually. I don’t like that image. So that’s why I specifically make it a point and struggle and fight to not put myself in those types of situations.” Will Smith created his clean-cut image to cover up his insecurities The megastar’s image has always been very important to him. But he admitted in his memoir that the clean-cut and cheerful public persona he created was crafted from tragedies he experienced in his past. Namely, watching his mother being abused by his father when he was a child, and feeling guilty for not interfering. “I couldn’t shake the idea that I had failed my mother and I was somehow unworthy of love and care because of my cowardice,” he wrote. “And that [was] the beginnings of wanting to overachieve and wanting to create and wanting to win and wanting to build an external life that could somehow and hopefully cover the pain.” This eventually led to the positive image many recognize him for. “That buoyant, happy, joyful image [of the Fresh Prince] was painted over a core of a real lack of self-esteem and self-respect,” he continued.
